## üìã Real-World Examples

### Same Question, Different Audiences

**Question:** "How does gravity work?"

**Elementary Student Response:**
> "Gravity is like a big hug from the Earth! You know how things fall down when you drop them? That's because of gravity! Imagine you have a magnet that attracts paper clips - gravity works similarly, but it attracts everything with mass towards the Earth..."

**High School Student Response:**
> "Gravity is a fundamental force of nature governed by Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation. The force is proportional to the product of two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them: F = G(m‚ÇÅm‚ÇÇ)/r¬≤..."

**Adult Learner Response:**
> "Gravity is a universal force that attracts objects with mass towards each other. According to Einstein's theory of general relativity, gravity results from the curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy..."
