Introduction to Biology

Biology is the scientific study of life and living organisms. It encompasses various levels of organization from molecules to ecosystems.

Major Branches of Biology:

1. Cell Biology
The study of cells, their structure, function, and behavior.

Cell Structure:
- Nucleus: Contains DNA and controls cell activities
- Mitochondria: Powerhouses of the cell, produce ATP
- Ribosomes: Protein synthesis factories
- Endoplasmic Reticulum: Transport system within the cell
- Golgi Apparatus: Modifies and packages proteins

Cell Types:
- Prokaryotic cells: No nucleus (bacteria)
- Eukaryotic cells: Have nucleus (plants, animals, fungi)

2. Genetics
The study of heredity and genetic variation.

Key Concepts:
- DNA: Deoxyribonucleic acid, carries genetic information
- Genes: Segments of DNA that code for traits
- Chromosomes: Structures containing many genes
- Mutations: Changes in DNA sequence
- Inheritance patterns: How traits pass from parents to offspring

Mendel's Laws:
- Law of Segregation: Each parent has two copies of each gene
- Law of Independent Assortment: Genes for different traits are inherited independently

3. Evolution
The change in heritable traits of biological populations over time.

Darwin's Theory of Natural Selection:
- Variation exists in populations
- Some variations are heritable
- More offspring are produced than can survive
- Individuals with favorable traits are more likely to survive and reproduce

Evidence for Evolution:
- Fossil record
- Comparative anatomy
- Molecular biology
- Biogeography
- Direct observation

4. Ecology
The study of interactions between organisms and their environment.

Levels of Organization:
- Individual organism
- Population (same species in an area)
- Community (different species in an area)
- Ecosystem (community plus environment)
- Biosphere (all ecosystems on Earth)

Energy Flow:
- Producers (plants) convert sunlight to chemical energy
- Primary consumers (herbivores) eat producers
- Secondary consumers (carnivores) eat primary consumers
- Decomposers break down dead organic matter

5. Human Biology
The study of human body structure and function.

Major Body Systems:
- Circulatory System: Heart, blood vessels, blood
- Respiratory System: Lungs, airways
- Digestive System: Stomach, intestines, liver
- Nervous System: Brain, spinal cord, nerves
- Immune System: Defends against disease
- Skeletal System: Bones and joints
- Muscular System: Muscles for movement

Photosynthesis:
The process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy.
Equation: 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + light energy → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂

Cellular Respiration:
The process by which cells break down glucose to release energy.
Equation: C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂ → 6CO₂ + 6H₂O + ATP

Important Biological Molecules:
- Carbohydrates: Energy storage and structure
- Proteins: Enzymes, structure, transport
- Lipids: Cell membranes, energy storage
- Nucleic acids: DNA and RNA for genetic information
