Introduction to Calculus

Calculus is a fundamental branch of mathematics that deals with rates of change and accumulation. It was developed independently by Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in the late 17th century.

Basic Concepts:

1. Derivatives
A derivative represents the rate of change of a function with respect to its variable. If you have a function f(x), its derivative f'(x) tells you how fast f(x) is changing at any point x.

Example: If f(x) = x², then f'(x) = 2x
This means that at x = 3, the function is changing at a rate of 6 units per unit increase in x.

Applications of Derivatives:
- Finding the slope of a curve at any point
- Determining maximum and minimum values
- Analyzing motion (velocity and acceleration)
- Optimization problems in economics and engineering

2. Integrals
Integration is the reverse process of differentiation. While derivatives measure rates of change, integrals measure accumulation or the area under curves.

Example: If f'(x) = 2x, then ∫2x dx = x² + C (where C is the constant of integration)

Applications of Integrals:
- Calculating areas and volumes
- Finding the total distance traveled given velocity
- Determining the center of mass
- Solving differential equations

3. Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
This theorem connects derivatives and integrals, showing that they are inverse operations.

The theorem states that if F(x) is an antiderivative of f(x), then:
∫[a to b] f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)

Common Derivative Rules:
- Power Rule: d/dx(x^n) = nx^(n-1)
- Product Rule: d/dx(uv) = u'v + uv'
- Chain Rule: d/dx(f(g(x))) = f'(g(x)) · g'(x)
- Quotient Rule: d/dx(u/v) = (u'v - uv')/v²

Common Integration Techniques:
- Substitution Method
- Integration by Parts
- Partial Fractions
- Trigonometric Substitution

Real-World Applications:
1. Physics: Calculating velocity and acceleration from position functions
2. Economics: Marginal cost and revenue analysis
3. Biology: Population growth models
4. Engineering: Optimization of structures and systems
5. Medicine: Drug concentration modeling in bloodstream
